This is a program doing the simplex algorithm.
This application was developped in PHP with CodeIgniter v2.2.0 Framework.

Configuration :
- Before running this application, make sure that you activated the apache module named 'rewrite_module'
- Then you need to configure the application with you local configuration. In that case, you need to modify the file /application/config/config.php. The line that you absolutely need to change is $config['base_url'] at the line 17.

Hope this application will help you with your project.
